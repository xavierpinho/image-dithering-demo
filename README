image-dithering-demo
====================

This repository contains straightforward implementations of various
well-known image dithering algorithms for my own educational purpose.


Quick start
-----------

cd src && make
cd ../eg && make

The commands above build and populate the eg directory with the
resulting images obtained from dithering the file kodim23.png.

The resulting images are in NetPBM's P1/P2/P3 file formats.


Building
--------

Run make inside the src directory.
The source code is in ANSI C but requires libpng.


Using
-----

Once built run the cli executable found inside the src directory.
You may run cli without parameters to get help.
